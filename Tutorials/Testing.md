### Testing Tutorial###
 Playwright Test provides a robust and versatile platform for automating browser-based tests, covering a wide range of use cases from simple page navigations to complex user interactions and validations. It is particularly useful for developers and testers aiming to ensure high-quality web applications across various browsers and environments.

### Writing tests ###
    Tests are written using the Playwrite API which provbides an high level way to control browser behavior. These tests describe the steps to interact with the web application like naviagting to a URL, clicking elements, and checking expected outcomes.

### Running Tests ###
    When you run a playwrite test, it launches a browser instance either with or without the UI. It then executes the actions described in your test scripts on the required brower instance.



### Example Code: ###


```bash
